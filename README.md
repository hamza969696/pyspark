The goal of this project is to select and work on analytics over big data in the healthcare domain. 
must define a healthcare scenario on which analytics would be useful, i.e., data collection and problem. 
Some possibilities are analytics from health records like lab test results, patient health history, data reported from healthcare devices, 
survey data from patient about their experience and satisfaction. Data can be generated by existing tools 
(e.g., https://www.onlinedatagenerator.com/Links to an external site.) 
and the implementation should be done using PySpark and RDD
